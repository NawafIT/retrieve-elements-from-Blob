## Retrieving Elements from Blob with ContinuationToken

The code in this section demonstrates how to retrieve elements from Azure Blob Storage using continuationToken. 

### Overview

Azure Blob Storage allows you to store large amounts of unstructured data, such as images, documents, and videos. When dealing with a large number of blobs, listing them all at once might not be feasible due to limitations on the number of items returned in a single request. ContinuationToken is a mechanism provided by Azure Blob Storage to handle pagination when listing blobs.


## Dependencies
[List the dependencies required to run the code along with their versions.]

- **@azure/identity**: Version 4.2.0
- **@azure/storage-blob**: Version 12.17.0


## Installation
[Provide detailed instructions on how to install the dependencies and set up the environment to run the code. You can include commands for package managers like npm or yarn.]

```bash
npm install @azure/identity@4.2.0 @azure/storage-blob@12.17.0
```

### Usage

To use this code, ensure that you have installed the required dependencies, including `@azure/identity` and `@azure/storage-blob` with the specified versions. Configure the connection to your Azure Blob Storage account by providing the necessary credentials and connection string.
Once configured, you can execute the code to retrieve elements from Blob Storage with continuationToken. Adjust the options for listing blobs as needed based on your specific scenario.
