## Retrieving Elements from Blob with ContinuationToken

The code in this section demonstrates how to retrieve elements from Azure Blob Storage using continuationToken. 

### Overview

Azure Blob Storage allows you to store large amounts of unstructured data, such as images, documents, and videos. When dealing with a large number of blobs, listing them all at once might not be feasible due to limitations on the number of items returned in a single request. ContinuationToken is a mechanism provided by Azure Blob Storage to handle pagination when listing blobs.

### Implementation

The code utilizes the `@azure/storage-blob` package to interact with Azure Blob Storage. It first establishes a connection to the storage account and retrieves the container client corresponding to the desired container.

Next, it sets up options for listing blobs, including parameters like includeMetadata, includeSnapshots, includeTags, includeVersions, and prefix. These options can be customized based on specific requirements.

The code then initializes an iterator to retrieve blobs in pages, with each page containing a maximum number of blobs specified by `maxPageSize`. It retrieves the first page of blobs using the `byPage` method and extracts the blob items along with the continuationToken.

It iterates through each blob item in the response and processes them accordingly. If there are more blobs to be retrieved, the continuationToken is used to fetch the next page of blobs until all blobs have been processed.


## Dependencies
[List the dependencies required to run the code along with their versions.]

- **@azure/identity**: Version 4.2.0
- **@azure/storage-blob**: Version 12.17.0


## Installation
[Provide detailed instructions on how to install the dependencies and set up the environment to run the code. You can include commands for package managers like npm or yarn.]

```bash
npm install @azure/identity@4.2.0 @azure/storage-blob@12.17.0
```

### Usage

To use this code, ensure that you have installed the required dependencies, including `@azure/identity` and `@azure/storage-blob` with the specified versions. Configure the connection to your Azure Blob Storage account by providing the necessary credentials and connection string.
Once configured, you can execute the code to retrieve elements from Blob Storage with continuationToken. Adjust the options for listing blobs as needed based on your specific scenario.
